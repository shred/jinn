# Note for translation:
#
# * This file uses a special and delicate syntax. Make sure
#   you know about it before you start your translation.
#   Especially, you must not change the content of text
#   which is embraced in curly braces, but you are allowed
#   to change their position within the text.
#
# * Translate from the German and English catalog in first
#   place.
#
# * You are allowed to adapt the menu/button mnemonic underscores
#   to your local conveniences.
#
# * After translation, test the entire program for mnemonic
#   duplicates, layout deformations, translation errors,
#   spelling mistakes etc.
